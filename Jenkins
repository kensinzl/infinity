1. Jenkin User Management
Manage User -> Create User for Developer or Admin
role-based plugin -> can not show on the download list

2. blue ocean plugin
quite easy step to combine github with the default navigation
one thing need to be remembered, it will generate the personal access token on the Github website
Setting -> Developer settings -> Personal access token

quick test
how to know jenkin embed which mavean
mavean docker build using maven volume
maven:3-alpine is not on the same network compared jenkins and postgres
so I have to use the --net=local 
already test to use the local maven to speed up the time



Jenkins Mail Configuration
1. E-mail Notification 
this one can be used to test the configuration is successful or not.

2. Jenkins Location
this one should be fullfilled the admin mail address.(must)

3. Extended E-mail Notification
this one is cnfigurated for Jenkins mail because you choose extended mail on the blue ocean
pipeline job.
you need to open qq.mail smtp mail service.
that means use qq mail server as your Jenkins sender mail address.
the following the pwd from qq server.
bswqpxncxgjibcdg
adapznkpecnzbcbi

4. Jenkins file is configured for Jenkins,
so this file can be auto generated by blue ocean or hand write.
Blue ocean will auto scan the jenkins file from your branch.

In order to success or fail job to receive the email, I need to add post for the Jenkins.
But unfortunately blue ocean seems no API to add based on the writting time.

the confusing is the setting, anyway google is fine.





1. Mac ip
ifconfig | grep inet

nslookup localhost

2. to see one port among Mac 
lsop -i tcp:8080

3.
lsof -i tcp:8080   -> you can know the pid, but you may dont know what is the pid doing
ps -ef | grep pid  
	-> you can know what the pid is doing

ps -ef | grep pid | grep -v grep 
	-> grep -v grep: eliminate the result contains grep character

ps -ef | grep spring-boot:run | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' 
	-> awk read the one row info and print the second column info


shell how to arrange one variable
PID=`ps -ef | grep spring-boot:run | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'`
PID=$(ps -ef | grep spring-boot:run | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
